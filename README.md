# Exploring-Game-Sales
Using a Kaggle Data Set this is one of my first projects in exploratory data analysis.

## About
This is my first project in exploratory data analysis. I used a dataset from <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/gregorut/videogamesales">Kaggle</a> that was created by user GregorySmith that was generated by a scrape of <a href="vg.chartz.com">Vg.Chartz.com</a>. The dataset contains a list of video games with sales greater than 100,000 copies. 

## Why this topic?
I chose to do this topic because Video Games is one of my favorite hobbies, and what better way to start my data analysis portfolio than by doing it on a topic that I really enjoy!

## What exactly are you trying to do with this data set? 
So for this project, I'm trying to analyze the trends in Video game sales as well as a brief analysis of the console wars that took place during the times that had the most video game sales. It's a very simple and straightforward analysis! 

## What did you use? 
<ul>
  <li>Python - Pandas</li>
  <li>Jupyter Notebook</li>
